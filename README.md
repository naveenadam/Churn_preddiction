* Project Title - Customer Churn Prediction
#Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning Today, I delved into the critical task of churn prediction using machine learning techniques. I used the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn. 

üîç **Key Steps**: 

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and converted data types. 

- Feature Selection: Identified key features influencing churn. 

- Model Building: Trained a Random Forest classifier. 

- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
